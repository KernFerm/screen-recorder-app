## Installation 🔧

To get started with this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- **OpenCV** (for video processing)
- **Pillow** (for image handling)
- **PyAutoGUI** (for screen capture and mouse operations)
- **NumPy** (for handling frame arrays)
- **customtkinter** (for a modern UI experience)
- **dxcam** (for optimized screen capture)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python-headless pillow pyautogui numpy customtkinter dxcam pyarmor
```


- For easier setup, you can use the provided `install_dependencies.bat` to install all required dependencies.

## Usage 💻

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kernferm/screen-recorder-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```

```

4. **Start Recording**: Press the `Start Recording` button to begin capturing your screen activities.

## How It Works 🧐

- **Screen Recording**: The app captures the screen using `dxcam` for efficient and high-quality video frames.

- **Saving the Video**: The frames are compiled and saved as an MP4 file, with an option for users to specify the file name.
